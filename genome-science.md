### Personal Genome Analysis

 * [Silk](http://xerial.org/silk): Cluser Computing Platform for Genome Sciences

Personal genome analysis involves massive amount of data analysis: genome sequence alignment, SNP calls, finding desease-related mutations, etc. These data analysis involves tons of data managment (e.g., compression, file I/O, table joins, filtering, etc.) Silk supports running these complex data analysis pipeline in a cluster machine.

### Genome Browser 
 * [**UTGB Toolkit**](http://utgenome.org) 

UTGB Toolkit is a bundle of Java libraries for developing web-based genome browsers. This includes portable Tomcat server, SQLite database engine (or connection to other DBMSs through JDBC), AJAX-style graphical user interface for data browsing, which is implemented using Google Web Toolkit (GWT).

### The Primary Transcriptome of *C. elegans*

- [WormTSS Web Site](http://wormtss.utgenome.org/) 

Despite the fundamental importance of transcription start sites (TSSs), little is known about TSSs in *C. elegans*. This is due to the high frequency of trans-splicing of C. elegans mRNAs, a process which post-transcriptionally removes RNA segments of variable length from the 5'end of mature mRNAs. WormTSS is a comprehensive collection of TSSs for trans-spliced genes generated from the sequencing of Illumina reads from pre-trans-splicing 5'-ends that were captured using a modified 5'-SAGE procedure. Our data provides an enabling resource for both experimental and theoretical analysis of gene structure and function in *C. elegans*.

### **The Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Morphological Database (SCMD)**

- [SCMD Web Site](http://scmd.gi.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp)
	
The Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Morphological Database(SCMD) is a collection of micrographs of budding yeast mutants. Micorgraphs of mutants with altered cell morphology were taken at Ohya Group, University of Tokyo, from a set of the haploid MATa deleted strains obtained from EUROSCARF. From the micrographs, disruptant cells are automatically extracted by our novel cell-image processing software developed at Morishita Group, University of Tokyo.
